Chessy Mess!

A crazy chessy game on an infinite board.

Build Instructions:

To build the front end, navigate to the ``frontend`` directory and run ``flutter build web``.
Then, go to the ``build/web`` subdirectory and run ``python -m http.server 8000``.

To build the back end, navigate to the ``backend`` directory and run ``stack run``.
You'll need to install a bunch of Haskell software first (I recommend using ``ghcup``).
